## Dev Environment & Run
- **PostgreSQL**: running on `localhost:5432` (database `payment_gateway`, user `postgres`).
- **To launch development server:**
	- Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\zaink\OneDrive\Desktop\api
.\dev_setup_and_run.ps1
```

This script activates the `venv`, installs dependencies, verifies `DATABASE_URL` is visible to Python, and starts the app with `uvicorn` in reload mode.
